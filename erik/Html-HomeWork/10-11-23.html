 <!-- Advanced JS: HTML/CSS/DOM basics


Task 1 (easy): Create a Basic Web Page with Event Listeners

1. Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) and a JavaScript file (e.g., script.js) in the same directory.

2. In index.html, create a minimal HTML structure: 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
            <button class="double">Double Click Me</button>
            <button class="click">Click Me</button> 


             Task 2 (medium): Change <p> tags to ðŸ˜Š
            1. Letâ€™s say we have a <div> and inside that <div> there is some text with several <p> tags.

            2. Change all the p tags with their contents into => ðŸ˜Š. 



             <div id="content">
                Why did the computer keep freezing? Because it caught a cold!
                <p>This paragraph is so funny, it will make you LOL (Laugh Out Loud).</p>
                Knock, knock. Who's there? Atch. Atch who? Bless you!
                <p>Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!</p>
                I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands.
                <p>Don't trust atoms; they make up everything!</p>
                Did you hear about the mathematician who's afraid of negative numbers? He'll stop at nothing to avoid them.
                <p>Parallel lines have so much in common; it's a shame they'll never meet.</p>
            </div> 
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html> -->
